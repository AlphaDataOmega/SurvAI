## üöÄ M2\_PHASE\_01.md ‚Äì Dynamic Question Engine: Offer-Based CTA Questions

### GOAL

Implement the dynamic question component system using offer-based CTA buttons, as seen in lead generation landing pages. These are not traditional questions ‚Äî they‚Äôre AI-generated persuasive prompts with clickable button variants that redirect to external offers, each tracked individually for EPC performance.

### OUTCOME

* Users see a question-style component with multiple CTA buttons.
* Each button links to a destination offer and is tracked via `{click_id}` and `{survey_id}`.
* Backend provides questions and variants dynamically.
* Clicks are logged, associated to session, and ready for EPC scoring.

### üì¶ FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

#### Backend

* [ ] `GET /questions/next` ‚Äì returns the next question + offer/button variant set for the session
* [ ] `POST /track-click` ‚Äì logs a click with session ID, question ID, offer ID, and variant copy
* [ ] Pixel URL generator in `trackingService.ts` ‚Üí returns URL like:

  ```ts
  https://tracking.domain.com/pixel?click_id={click_id}&survey_id={survey_id}
  ```
* [ ] Update `question` and `offer` models to include:

  * button copy variants (stored in JSON)
  * order priority
  * active/inactive flag

#### Frontend

* [ ] `QuestionCard.tsx` ‚Äì renders prompt, subtext, CTA buttons, and a "No Thanks"
* [ ] `OfferButton.tsx` ‚Äì renders individual clickable button variant (with tracking + open in new tab)
* [ ] On click:

  * Send `POST /track-click`
  * Open offer URL in new tab with appended `click_id` + `survey_id`
* [ ] Handle layout and spacing for variable button counts (Tailwind: `space-y-4` or grid layout)

### üß™ VALIDATION

* [ ] A session retrieves a CTA-style question
* [ ] Buttons open offer links in new tabs with correct parameters
* [ ] Backend logs each click (and can be viewed in DB)
* [ ] Pixel URL is generated correctly
* [ ] Question variants rotate properly per session

### üìé AI INTEGRATION TARGETS

* [ ] Use `question_details` to generate prompt and subtext
* [ ] Use `question_rules` to control button copy and offer links
* [ ] Generate button copy variants and test performance based on clicks

### üîç REFERENCE

* Visual reference: \[Attached Screenshot]
* Context: SurvAI survey questions are monetization CTAs, not traditional forms
* CLAUDE.md: Follow conventions for modularity, testing, and separation of logic
* PLANNING.md: Component structure and endpoint architecture
