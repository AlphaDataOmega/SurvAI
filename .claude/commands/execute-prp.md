# Execute BASE PRP

Implement a feature using using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENT1
## Execution Process Step: $ARGUMENT2

## Execution Process Steps

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass

5. **Cleanup**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything
   - Compact Memory

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - You always reference the PRP again.

7. **Review the code**
   - Review the code to ensure it is correct
   - Ensure all code is correct and makes sense according to the PRP
   - Take NOTES.md if there are placeholders or mock data. 

8. **Visual Validation** (if needed)
   - review /docs/VISUAL_TESTING.md
   - perform visual validation
   - Fix any visual issues
   - take NOTES.md if needed

10. **Documentation**
   - review/update all root README.md files
   - review/update all docs/ files
   - add a new file if needed

11. **Examples**
   - take a look at the /examples folder
   - review/update all examples
   - add a new example if needed

   
Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.
