## Discovered During Work

### Research Insights
- **Server-to-Server tracking preferred over pixel tracking** in 2024 due to cookie deprecation
- **Idempotent pixel firing** is critical industry requirement to prevent double-conversions
- **Joi validation** already used in codebase, provides consistent validation patterns
- **Atomic transactions** already implemented for EPC calculations, need to extend to conversions

### Codebase Analysis
- **TrackingService.markConversion()** needs idempotent checking before updates
- **Input validation** missing from tracking endpoints but patterns exist in validateEnv.ts
- **Session + offer validation** partially implemented but needs enhancement
- **Testing patterns** comprehensive, can be extended for new functionality

### External Documentation
- Industry best practices from Trackier, Partnero, and affiliate marketing platforms
- Prisma transaction documentation for atomic operations
- Joi validation API documentation for schema implementation
- 2024 affiliate tracking security and privacy compliance requirements
